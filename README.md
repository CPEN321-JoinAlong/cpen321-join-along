# JoinAlong!
## Goal
Our project strives to strengthen community ties and allow people to find new friends and become more active in a time where socializing is difficult in person. We aim to break down the barriers and dissolve the hesitancy behind meeting new people by making it simple for anyone to organize a group event. 

## Target Audience
Our target audience includes adults who want to socialize with new people, visually and intuitively plan an outing or trip, or do group activities but donâ€™t have enough people to join them.
